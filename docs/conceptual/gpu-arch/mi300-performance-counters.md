# MI300 performance counters and metrics
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->

This document lists and describes the hardware performance counters and derived metrics available on the AMD Instinct™ MI300 GPU. All the hardware basic counters and derived metrics are accessible via {doc}`ROCProfiler tool <rocprofiler:rocprofv1>`.

## MI300 performance counters list

See the category-wise listing of MI300 performance counters in the following tables.

```{note}
Preliminary validation of all MI300 performance counters is in progress. Those with “*” appended to the names require further evaluation.
